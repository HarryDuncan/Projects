Create a website for La Boutique cassee, a book/bluray online store

Main outcomes was to use JSON objects to communicate with servers.
-Due to this being an assignment I copy pasted code for the html and css
from my own personal website (which I hand coded) do acomplish the task quickly (hence why parts are similar to my portfolio)

-If request do not send/not work it is likely that the university has shut down the servers.
